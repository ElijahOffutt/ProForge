## 📖 About

**ProForge** is a next-generation resume management tool. It’s built for the people — not the platforms. Built using **Rust** and **VueJS**, and packaged with **Tauri**, it offers a performant, privacy-respecting, and deeply intentional experience for crafting professional résumés.

This project was inspired by [Reactive Resume](https://rxresu.me/), but **ProForge rejects the React ecosystem** in favor of something faster, safer, and more transparent. We aim to foster a healthier web and better developer habits by forging professional software that's:
- **Security-first**
- **Cloud-optional**
- **Decentralization-minded**
- **Educational-by-design**
- **Efficient and Performant**

## 🌟 Core Philosophies

- 🚫 **No React. Ever.**  
  React has dominated the web long enough. We believe in moving beyond the monoculture and building stronger, safer alternatives using languages and frameworks that optimize for developer sanity and system health and not based on industry group think and lemming behavior.

- 📚 **Teach Through Usage**  
  ProForge is not just a tool — it’s a learning experience. As users interact with features, the app will explain _why_ things are built the way they are. Expect inline docs, thoughtful UX, and transparent choices.

- 🦀 **Rust for a Stronger Web**  
  Rust brings security, speed, and correctness to the table. It’s the foundation of ProForge and our belief that the software you install should be trustworthy and maintainable.

- 🆓 **Free as in Freedom**  
  Software should empower, not exploit. ProForge is open-source and will always remain free to use, inspect, and improve.

- 🌍 **Community-Centric Design**  
  Our communities deserve tools that work for **them** — not just Silicon Valley. ProForge helps people build better lives, from job seekers to business leaders, with local-first, user-owned data models.

- 💻 **Decentralized > Cloud-Locked**  
  Your data is **yours**. ProForge stores everything locally by default, with optional secure syncing if needed. We're taking back the power of the **personal computer**.

- 🧘🏾 **Simplicity is Sovereignty**  
  ProForge avoids unnecessary complexity. Every feature should _earn_ its place. The UI and dev experience should be clean, accessible, and understandable.
